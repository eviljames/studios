PHAT is a collection of GTK+ widgets geared toward pro-audio apps.
The goal is to eliminate duplication of effort and provide some
standardization (well, at least for GTK+ apps). It's open source
software, licensed under the GNU GPL, version 2.0 or later.

NOTE: libgnomecanvas is required to build phat.
