# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

bitmeter: BitMeter (JACK Diagnostics Tool)
bitmeter:
bitmeter: JACK BitMeter is a diagnostics tool for JACK audio software on 
bitmeter: Linux (and perhaps other systems which have JACK and GTK+ 2.x). As
bitmeter: its name might suggest, the bitmeter operates at the bare metal of 
bitmeter: JACK's I/O layer, looking at the 32 binary digits in each invidiual
bitmeter: sample.
