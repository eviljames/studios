JACK Rack is an effects "rack" for the JACK low latency audio API. The rack
can be filled with LADSPA effects plugins and can be controlled using the 
ALSA sequencer. It's phat; it turns your computer into an effects box.

JACK Rack requires JACK, GTK+2, LADSPA 1.1+, liblrdf, raptor (all part of
the core StudioS dependencies) and LASH (build script provided by StudioS)
