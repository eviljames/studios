amSynth stands for Analogue Modeling SYNTHesizer.

It provides virtual analogue synthesis in the style of the classic
Moog Minimoog/Roland Junos. It offers an easy-to-use interface and
synth engine, while still creating varied sounds.

This package requires gtkmm, which is available from SlackBuilds.org.
An optional requirement is libsndfile, which is also available at
  SlackBuilds.org.

Note: If you want to use this package with jack, then jack
  needs to be installed when you build this package.
  The configure step will include jack if its available.
